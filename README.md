### Education
BSc. Biomedical Engineering

#### Solutions and Project Engineer | Gulf Drug  
**Duration:** [November, 2023] – [November, 2024]  
As a Solutions and Project Engineer, I supported the sales and technical teams by delivering customized solutions for surgical and medical equipment projects. I managed high-value Turnkey projects, prepared detailed quotations, and coordinated with suppliers to ensure the timely delivery of equipment. Additionally, I played a key role in CRM management and data analysis to track project progress and ensure customer satisfaction.

- Led the development and implementation of equipment proposals for major surgical projects.
- Worked closely with the sales and operations teams to ensure smooth project execution.
- Coordinated technical support and troubleshooting for complex equipment setups.
- Negotiated with suppliers for optimal pricing and cost-effective solutions.

#### Internship | Alcon, Analytical Science & Technology (AS&T) Team  
**Duration:** [March, 2023] – [September, 2023]   
---

During my internship with Alcon's AS&T team, I collaborated with R&D to optimize configuration parameters for an optical parameters machine. My primary goal was to utilize a supplier-provided confidential Python library to analyze machine performance and achieve significant improvements.

### Key Contributions:
- **Data Generation & Management:**  
  Developed Python scripts to generate ~50 large datasets, each containing 7,000–10,000 rows and 10–15 columns, for parameter optimization.

- **Data Analysis:**  
  Analyzed and compared calculated values with actual results to identify trends, patterns, and optimal configurations.

- **Optimization Process:**  
  Used insights from data analysis to recommend the best configuration parameters, enhancing the machine's accuracy and reliability.

- **Data Management:**  
  Gained experience working with large-scale datasets, ensuring efficient processing and clear data organization.

- **Baseline Comparison:**  
  Began with the supplier's default parameters as a baseline and compared them to those derived from my data analysis.

- **Performance Improvement:**  
  The optimized parameters I developed improved performance by **90%** over the supplier’s default configuration.

This experience allowed me to apply Python programming and data analysis techniques to solve real-world engineering problems, forming a strong foundation for my current focus on data science.

### Data Science Projects

- **Analyzing Test Scores Across NYC Public Schools**  
  Used data manipulation and summary statistics techniques to analyze and visualize the distribution of test scores across different schools in New York City. The project involved cleaning the data, calculating key metrics, and providing insights into the performance trends across school districts.

- **Movie Data Analysis with Python**  
  Applied foundational Python skills learned in the **Introduction to Python** and **Intermediate Python** courses to manipulate and visualize movie data. This project involved using libraries like pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore relationships between movie features like budget, revenue, and rating.
