### Education
BSc. Biomedical Engineering

#### Solutions and Project Engineer | Gulf Drug  
**Duration:** [November, 2023] – [November, 2024]  
As a Solutions and Project Engineer, I supported the sales and technical teams by delivering customized solutions for surgical and medical equipment projects. I managed high-value Turnkey projects, prepared detailed quotations, and coordinated with suppliers to ensure the timely delivery of equipment. Additionally, I played a key role in CRM management and data analysis to track project progress and ensure customer satisfaction.

- Led the development and implementation of equipment proposals for major surgical projects.
- Worked closely with the sales and operations teams to ensure smooth project execution.
- Coordinated technical support and troubleshooting for complex equipment setups.
- Negotiated with suppliers for optimal pricing and cost-effective solutions.

#### Internship | Alcon, Analytical Science & Technology (AS&T) Team  
**Duration:** [March, 2023] – [September, 2023]   

During my internship with Alcon's AS&T team, I collaborated with R&D to optimize configuration parameters for an optical parameters machine. My primary goal was to utilize a supplier-provided confidential Python library to analyze machine performance and achieve significant improvements.

### Key Contributions:
- **Data Generation & Management:**  
  Developed Python scripts to generate ~50 large datasets, each containing 7,000–10,000 rows and 10–15 columns, for parameter optimization.

- **Data Analysis:**  
  Analyzed and compared calculated values with actual results to identify trends, patterns, and optimal configurations.

- **Optimization Process:**  
  Used insights from data analysis to recommend the best configuration parameters, enhancing the machine's accuracy and reliability.

- **Data Management:**  
  Gained experience working with large-scale datasets, ensuring efficient processing and clear data organization.

- **Baseline Comparison:**  
  Began with the supplier's default parameters as a baseline and compared them to those derived from my data analysis.

- **Performance Improvement:**  
  The optimized parameters I developed improved performance by **90%** over the supplier’s default configuration.

This experience allowed me to apply Python programming and data analysis techniques to solve real-world engineering problems, forming a strong foundation for my current focus on data science.

- **Breast Cancer Dataset Exploration**  
  In this project, I worked with a Breast Cancer dataset to analyze and explore the relationship between various tumor characteristics and their diagnosis (Benign or Malignant). By utilizing Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib, I created a series of visualizations, including bar plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices, to identify key patterns in the data.  
  The project involved:
  - Visualizing tumor features such as size, shape, and texture.
  - Comparing the characteristics of Benign and Malignant tumors.
  - Using statistical analysis to uncover correlations between tumor features and diagnosis.
  - Laying the groundwork for developing machine learning models to classify tumors based on these characteristics.

  The insights gained from this analysis provide a strong foundation for future predictive modeling and healthcare-related data science applications.
