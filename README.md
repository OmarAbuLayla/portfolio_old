During my internship with Alcon's AS&T team, I collaborated with R&D to optimize configuration parameters for an optical parameters machine. My primary goal was to utilize a supplier-provided confidential Python library to analyze machine performance and achieve significant improvements.

### Key Contributions:
- **Data Generation & Management:**  
  Developed Python scripts to generate ~50 large datasets, each containing 7,000–10,000 rows and 10–15 columns, for parameter optimization.

- **Data Analysis:**  
  Analyzed and compared calculated values with actual results to identify trends, patterns, and optimal configurations.

- **Optimization Process:**  
  Used insights from data analysis to recommend the best configuration parameters, enhancing the machine's accuracy and reliability.

- **Data Management:**  
  Gained experience working with large-scale datasets, ensuring efficient processing and clear data organization.

- **Baseline Comparison:**  
  Began with the supplier's default parameters as a baseline and compared them to those derived from my data analysis.

- **Performance Improvement:**  
  The optimized parameters I developed improved performance by **90%** over the supplier’s default configuration.

This experience allowed me to apply Python programming and data analysis techniques to solve real-world engineering problems, forming a strong foundation for my current focus on data science.
